This repository showcases a series of **practical cybersecurity projects** I have completed as part of my learning journey. Each project demonstrates hands-on skills in **ethical hacking, penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, web/mobile security, malware analysis, and digital forensics**.  

> All activities were performed in **legal, controlled environments** for educational purposes.
