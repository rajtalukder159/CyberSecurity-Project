This repository showcases a series of practical **ethical hacking** and **cybersecurity** projects completed as part of my learning and personal research. Each project demonstrates the use of industry-standard tools for vulnerability assessment, exploitation, malware analysis, cloud enumeration, and more.

All activities were performed in **legal, controlled environments** for **educational purposes only**.
